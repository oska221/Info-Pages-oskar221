    <h1>Welcome to Info Pages</h1>
    <p>
      These info pages contain all the details about my projects.  
      Here you will find comprehensive project descriptions, articles, tutorials, examples, and all resources related to my work.  
      The structure is clear: on the left side there is a menu with categories and articles,  
      and on the right side is the main content area where the selected articles are displayed.  
      This allows you to quickly and conveniently browse information about my projects and solutions.
